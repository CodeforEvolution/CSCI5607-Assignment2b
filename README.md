Learning About Viewing, Projection and Viewport Transformations via a First-Person 3D Walkthrough

Work by Jacob Secunda

### Some Notes
- All base functionality should be implemented.
- Additionally, the extra credit ability to translate the camera up and down is implemented too.
- My code should be compilable using the CMake build system without any special extra steps.

### Controls
- W,A,S,D - Moves the camera forward, left, backward, and right accordingly
- Left and Right Arrows - Rotates the camera left and right
- Left and Right Square Brackets - Moves the camera up and down.
